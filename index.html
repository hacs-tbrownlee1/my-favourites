                C++ is a low-level compiled programming language. Its standard library is very rich
                in features, and there are countless other libraries written for C++ for extra
                functionality. Compilers for C++ exist for almost every platform imaginable.
                Common compilers include:

                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a></li>

                I program in C++ not because it is easy, but because it is hard. I like challenges.

                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a> is a first-person shooter game from 2007, and it is still alive after
                16 years. I play it because of the unique gameplay and the humourous
                voice lines.
